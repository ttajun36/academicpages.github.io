Interested In
======
When I have a lot of free time, I like to read books, whether literary, non-literary, or philosophical.
After going to the Busan International Film Festival, 
I became interested in movies and try to watch them whenever I can. 
For sports, I like to play basketball, tennis, and jogging. 
My goal is to enrich my life through various hobbies. 

I love to listen to music, and I can listen to almost any genre, including hip-hop, ballads, indie, jazz, and rock. I love to go to performances, concerts, and festivals, and my favorite singers are Black Skirt, Beenzino, Sungsikyung, and Jangkiha Band.
