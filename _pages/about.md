Hello, my name is Um Tae-joon, and I'm a third-year student who recently returned to school after completing military service in 2022. I'm major in EECS(Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) and minor in Mathematics. I'm currently enrolled in a data engineering class taught by Professor [Sundong Kim](https://sundong.kim/) and this is my first time to create my own webpage.

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed solving math problems and puzzles, which eventually led me to pursue a degree in engineering. During high school, I was introduced to programming through Java and found that it had a similar problem-solving approach to mathematics. It was these experiences that ultimately motivated me to pursue a major in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and a minor in Mathematics at GIST.

During my freshman year, I enjoyed participating in various club activities, but my sophomore year was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and I spent most of my time at home feeling lonely and empty. As a result, I decided to join the military.

Returning to school has been a bit challenging, as I feel like I'm lacking knowledge and have a lot of catching up to do. However, I'm determined to work hard and make up for lost time.
